In this project, i used the BDD format Cucumber with Java framework

In this project, all the main work is maintained in 3 packages. Those are

	1) Feature File (All the Features are outlined in Gherkin language)
	2) StepDefinations (Implementation for the features in the Feature file)
	3) Runner File (The Execution will initiate from this file)
	
	The Structure i followed in this Project is, 
	
	Wrappers package contains Wrapper Interface and GenericWrapper class. In Wrapper interface contains all the Services or all the Methods 
	with out their Implementation known as Abstract Methods.
	
	GenericWrapper class contains all the Implementations of the methods declared in the Wrapper Interface which is extends the Reporting
	
	runnerfile package contains Runner class, it extends the GenericWrappers and contains all the TestNG annotations, CucumberOptions
	
	All the pages maintained in the point.pages package which contains only AboutUsPage and IndexPage for the assignment purpose
	
	Utils package contains the Reporting class contains all the necessary steps for the Reporting purpose. For example Start report, 
	Start test, take snap, end report & end test
	
	
	config.properties maintains all the Locators used for on the pages. This is useful to maintain all the locators in one place for 
	easy maintains. For example if we have 1000 test cases, if is there any change in one Locator, instead of going to each and every 
	test case we can change in the config file and it will reflect in all the test cases.
	
	
	drivers folder contains the browser drivers, presently i am using only chromedriver which is version 89.0.4389.90 on 64 bit . 
	We can use multiple browsers as well
	
	
	reports folder contains the screenshots and results.html
	
	pom.xml contains all the Maven dependencies used for the project including their versions
	
	Pre requists:
	Eclipse
	Java libraries
